4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: objects are created from classes

  Researched answer: Many people get confused by the difference between class and object. The difference is simple and conceptual. A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.
